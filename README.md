Assignment description:

5.15 (Drawing patterns with nested for loops)
 Write a program that uses for statements to print the following patterns separately, one below the other. Use for loops to generate the 
 patterns. All asterisks () should be printed by a single statement of the form cout << ''; (this causes the asterisks to print side by 
 side). [Hint: The last two patterns require that each line begin with an appropriate number of blanks.]
